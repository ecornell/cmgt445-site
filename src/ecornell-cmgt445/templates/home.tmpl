<h2 id="mov">Measurable Organizational Value (MOV)</h2>
Business Need/Problem 1: 	Riordan currently has multiple HR systems and processes used within the organization.  This duplication of data and functionality is a source of many operational inefficiencies within the organization.
Objective 1.1: 	Combine the multiple HR systems and processes into a single unified system.
Measurement 1.1.1:  	A reduction in duplicated HR related data within the organization.
Measurement 1.1.2:  	A reduction in the time necessary to complete HR related processes.
Anticipated Benefit(s): 	Reduced duplication of effort and data, Increase in organizational process efficiency


<h2 id="roi">Project Return on Investment (ROI)</h2>
<p>The organization projects an annual operational saving of $275,000 a year post implementation.  The source of these saves stem from the elimination of individually licensed and supported HR systems within the organization.  In addition, the organization estimates that the new system will reduce the resource costs associated with performing HR related processes by $50,000 annually.  At this rate, the project costs will be recovered within 4 years after implementation.</p>

<h2 id="risks">Assumptions and Risks</h2>

<h4>Project Assumptions</h4>
•	Riordan will dedicate the necessary resources to the project full time.
•	The COTS solution will be implementation as-is when possible with minimal customization.

<h4>Key Risks</h4>
Risk	Probability	Impact
Failure to provide the necessary Riordan resources full time	Medium 	Project will be delayed
Data migration issues	Medium	Project will be delayed
The COTS solution will require extensive customization.	Low	Project will be delayed

<h4>Organizational / Time Constraints</h4>
Riordan would like to have the new system in place before January 1, 2016.  The driver to meet this date is that the licensing agreements for many of the legacy HR systems are up for renewal at that time.

<h4>Risks of Not Doing the Project</h4>
The primary risk of not implementing the new system is that the legacy systems are running on aging hardware with an increasing risk of failure.  Another key risk is that the total costs associated with implementing a new system HR will only continue to increase over time.

<h4>Project Dependencies</h4>
There are no major external dependencies identified that could adversely affect the project.

<h4>Organizational Impact of Project</h4>
Riordan’s management and the project team will coordinate to manage the organizational impact of the project.  The groups will communicate and establish clear expectations of the project via internal staff communications and the formal on-site training sessions.

<h4>Outstanding Project Issues</h4>
There are no outstanding project issues at this time.

<h4>Risk Mitigation Strategies</h4>
The project team will follow the organization’s established change management processes to handle any project risks that materialize into issues.  Depending on the issue severity, the project team may require direction and prioritization from the project’s sponsor and stakeholders regarding the mitigation approach.

<h2 id="project-admin">Project Administration</h2>
Communications Plan
The project manager will be responsible for the creation of an internal communications plan.  The plan will detail how the project team keeps the appropriate individuals informed on important project related status and activities.

<h4>Scope Management Plan</h4>
The project team, particularly the project managers and assigned business analysts, will work with the vendor to manage the overall scope of the project.  The initial project scope will be based on an agreed upon set of requirements and will act as a baseline to form the project schedule.  As the project progresses, all deviations from the baseline requirements will follow the established change management process.

<h4>Quality Management Plan</h4>
The project manager and QA lead will be responsible for creating a quality management plan.  The plan will identify the project’s key quality requirements and methods the team will use to verify the solution.  As the solution entered UAT, the plan will outline the processes used to manage the identified defects in detail.  In addition, the plan will detail the acceptance criteria for performance, security, and recovery testing efforts.

<h4>Change Management Plan</h4>
The project manager will create a change management plan that describes how the team will manage changes to the project’s scope.  This will include a method to categorize and prioritize changes based on their identified need and risk.  In addition, an escalation process will be form to ensure that the project’s sponsor and key stakeholders are involved in any significant decisions regarding cost, schedule, or quality.

<h4>Human Resource Plan</h4>
The project manager will create a human resource plan that will identify the key project roles and responsibilities of the team members during the project.  In addition, the plan will contain a project organizational chart and a staffing management plan.  The staffing plan will identify project resource needs in terms on skillsets and timelines.


<h2 id="plans">Implementation and Continued Maintenance and Project Closure Plan</h2>

<h4>Production Systems Impact</h4>
Upon implementation of the new system, the existing legacy HR system will be shutdown.

<h4>Required Downtime</h4>
The implementation of the new system is scheduled to occur over the weekend between 11/13/15 – 11/15/15 to minimize the operation impact of the change.  During this timeframe all HR related systems will be unavailable.

<h4>Deployment Communication</h4>
The organization will communicate the deployment schedule and any potential operation impacts to the affected staff on a scheduled basis leading up to the implementation date.

<h4>Deployment Model</h4>
The plan is to deploy the new HR new system as a single, clean cutover from the existing legacy systems.

<h4>Support and Maintenance</h4>
The plan is to utilize the organization’s existing support center and ticketing system to manage all post0-produciton system issues.  Once logged, the organization’s IT staff will triage the issues and escalate any support issues to the supporting software vendor if deemed necessary.

<h4>Project Closure</h4>
Once deployed into the production environment successfully, the project sponsor will formally approve the project deliverables and the project manager will begin the process of closing out the project.  However if issues occur that cannot be remediated acceptability during the course of the project, the sponsor had the ability to terminate the project at any time.
